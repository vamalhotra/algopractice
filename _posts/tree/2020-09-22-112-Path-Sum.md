# 112. Path Sum

Easy

Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.

**Note:** A leaf is a node with no children.

**Example:**

Given the below binary tree and `sum = 22`,

```
      5
     / \
    4   8
   /   / \
  11  13  4
 /  \      \
7    2      1
```

return true, as there exist a root-to-leaf path `5->4->11->2` which sum is 22.

## Solution:

```c#
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     public int val;
 *     public TreeNode left;
 *     public TreeNode right;
 *     public TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }

{
	//Time Complexity: O(N) where N is the total number of nodes in the tree.
	//Space Complexity: O(N), this space will be used to store the recursion stack. The worst case will happen when the given tree is a linked list (i.e. every node has only one child)
    public bool HasPathSum(TreeNode root, int sum) {
        if(root == null) return false;
        
        if(root.left == null && root.right == null && root.val == sum)
        {
            return true;
